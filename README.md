# scratch-mesh-loader
turns meshes into csv files

How to use:

1. download python

2. run `pip install trimesh[easy]`

3. download and run the program, and input all file names of the meshes (the files should be in the python program's path)

4. load the files mesh and mesh_start into their respective list in [my scratch proect](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/719429447)

if you have a lot of meshed, I recomend putting all the file names in a file, and the copy and pasting it in, so you don't have to type each name in every time
